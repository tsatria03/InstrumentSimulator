Welcome to my instrument simulator. This app was created for those who are musically gifted.
When you first open the app, a message will pop up with instructions on how to play keys with your computer keyboard, along with other useful commands that's sure to make this app more enjoyable for everyone else to play and use.
Have fun! Oh and also, you are now able to create your own instruments to play in the drum and piano folders of the main instruments folder.
